You’re gonna figure it out soon enough - so I’ll say it first. Every idea here is directly stolen from 
[Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Do-It-Yourself/dp/0321657292) [
RSME].

If you haven’t 
 the 
RSME book, its quite thin at just 168 pages. But you'd still need (by the author's own admission) at least 3-4 hours to finish the book.

Does that mean that you don't need to read it and can just read this series instead - and still do a good usability test with just 20-30 min of reading this 4 part series? If only life were that easy :) 
[1]

Once you’ve read the book, you can use these posts as a quick refresher of the key ideas in the book - just before you start your next usability test.


<!-- <b>Already a fan of usability testing? Skip this section.</b> -->##What is Usability Testing?

Simply put, its just observing a user while they use your product. Ideally the test user you’re observing hasn’t heard of your product before and can therefore help simulate the experience of a new user user on your site.

The only way to confirm without doubt that 
 can use your product  without getting confused or frustrated - is to get 
to use it. Don’t agree? Here’s some facts:

*All sites have problems.

	
*Most serious problems tend to be easy to find (but only for someone 
 to the site)
We’ll walk through some of the types of issues usually discovered in a Usability Test soon. But first, let’s look at some of the objections we often hear about Usability Tests.

##"Why isn’t this thing being done more often?"

Here’s a couple of facts:

*Usability Testing is one of the single most important things that can help build better products.

	
*Its super easy to do

	
*In spite of both of the above reasons, there's still so few people doing it

##"Its not just me, I need to convince the others too."

Here’s why your team or your management is probably not yet convinced and what 
 can tell them:

What they might tell you

Your response

“We’re not experts at this Usability Testing stuff”

“You don’t need to be. That’s why its called 
. Anyone can do this stuff. Its insanely simple while being incredibly valuable.
Let’s watch 
[this video](http://youtu.be/QckIzHC99Xc) during our next coffee break.”

“There’s no time for this, because there’s too many other things going on.”

“We just need one morning a month for this stuff.” 
[2][3]

“We’re not done yet. Its kinda obvious what the users are gonna say.”

“Yes, the users will say some things that we already know about. But they will also say things that we don’t know about.”

“We don’t have the resources to invest in this”

“It costs almost nothing. Of course, it would be cool if we offered some kind of incentive (even some nice memorabilia will do) and served lunch/snacks - for the user testers we invited over to our office.”

>“Measure twice, cut once” - Being a smart tailor

Take a look at this (classic!) flow-chart from the 
RSME book:


[![Flowchart for When to do usability testing](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog-Post-Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Part-1-e1415196363412.jpg)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog-Post-Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Part-1.jpg)

Its much less expensive to discover usability issues before you even have 
working software. Unfortunately, the worst practice is also the most common: waiting to test the site until its done and ready to launch.

Here’s a quick list of reasons you’re probably gonna hear - and what your response should be to each of them:

Your Team

Your Response

“We haven’t even started writing code yet”

“Exactly. There’s no better time to start. Let’s just start with whatever we have - even rough sketches are fine”

“The rough sketches are too...err..rough”

“People are actually more comfortable to comment on something that is rough (because its easier to change)”

>“
”
- Classic quote from the book


##But you can do this

Here’s what Jakob Nielsen (one of the foremost experts on Usability) says:

>“
 should be doing 
 user testing, while professionals should be doing things that require more skill and user experience.”

So don’t worry, you just can’t go wrong with this stuff.

##What you won’t find in this 4 part series:

You won’t find any formal stuff here. You also won’t find anything that will help you prove anything to anybody.


What you will find: A quick checklist of things to keep handy just before and after your usability tests.

##How should we fix the problems we find in the usability tests?

That stuff will come in part 4. (

##“What should we test and how should we test it?”


What type of site?

What to test?

How to test?

Redesign of existing site

Test your existing site first.

Use the techniques in part 2.
Also fix the biggest issues on your existing site, if it can be done quickly enough. Don't make your existing users suffer while you're building your new site.

Building a new site?

Test another site that is very similar to the one you wanna build.
Actually test as many of sites as you can - so you can test out multiple design approaches.

Use the techniques in part 2.
Keep these in mind as well:

*Ask the user tester to perform the same tasks you’d want them to perform if it were your site.

	
*This is a quick and super cheap way of learning about the pros and cons of a certain design approach - before you take a similar route in your own product

	
*Your management is gonna love this one.

	
*This is a great way to get new folks to get their feet wet with Usability Testing.

Building a new site?

Test sketch on a napkin.

*Figure out whether the concept is easy to understand.

	
*Ask “Describe what you think this site does”

	
*“What’s your opinion of this site?". That is, focus on getting them to perform tasks, don’t ask for their opinions.

Building a new site?

Test the wireframes

Wireframes are very useful for testing how easy it is to navigate and find things on your site.For example, if you’re building an e-commerce site selling baby products, ask them:-
"How would you find diapers on this site?"
If they’re able to “navigate” through the wireframes quickly enough to “find” the desired product, then you’re good. Otherwise, you probably need to take another look at how you’ve categorized products on the site and also how clearly you’ve named those categories.

Here’s a video of 
[how to test using a paper prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7M0fVXdovM).

Building a new site?

Test Page Designs [that is, the PSDs]

Ask your test users to do a narrative while looking at the PSD’s - here’s a script from the book that you could use:“Look at this page and tell me what you make of it; What strikes you about it, whose site you think it, what you can do here and what it’s for.”
Sometimes the visual design can introduce new usability issues that were not present in the wireframes. This is a good way to figure those out before you start development. Any new usability issues introduced between wireframes and designs?

Building a new site?

Testing working pieces and beyond

Part 2 covers this bit in detail. You should get a lot of insights with each usability test of each part of the site.

[1] 
 if you haven't read it yet. It is phenomenally good.

[2] Since you’re the person organizing the test, you’ll need to spend around 2 days prepping for organizing the whole thing [“...deciding what to test, choosing the tasks, writing scenarios, recruiting participants, and getting all the stakeholders to attend..” - 
RSME, Page 26]. After the first couple of tests, you may be able bring this effort down to just a day.

[3] If you’re concerned about the investment to recruit testers from a certain demographic or having special skills, this is not important in most cases. You can learn a lot just by observing 2-3 general folks (per month) using your product.
