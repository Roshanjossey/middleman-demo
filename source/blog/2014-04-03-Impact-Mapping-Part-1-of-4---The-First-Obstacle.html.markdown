Feature prioritization is possibly the biggest challenge for any software team and Impact Mapping provides solutions for most of our problems. But, is it easy to adapt the solution in our project?

I will walk you through a case where we used Impact Mapping to elevate the performance of the team. We were working with a customer on 3 different products and the association had lasted more than 8 months.


By the end of this activity, we wanted the team to visualize the following goals and metrics(the goals and numbers are for visualization and are not actual customer data) : 

*Primary goal of the organization (like 1,000,000 active users on an e-commerce service in the next financial year)

	
*Prioritized secondary goals to achieve the business goal (Get 500,000 visitors to the site in the next 30 days, Convert 50% (250,000) of the visitors to active users in next 60 days)

	
*Metrics to measure the Primary and Secondary level goals:


*Get 2M transaction / month

	
*Get 500,000 sign up in a month

	
*Get 250 transaction / month
Although the software team doesn't define the primary (business) goal, we need to understand it to help the business team define secondary (operational) goals and to suggest approaches to achieve these goals.


Well, this was our first bottle neck - understanding the business goal and to define/prioritize the operational goal. 

With tight schedules, multiple apps in production and a constantly growing team, it became hard for everyone on the team to understand and/or to remember both these goals. In time the team had moved out of the habit of looking at the big picture.


This was the obstacle we needed to clear!


To begin with, we came up with a list of questions and teamed up with the product managers to answer those questions. Not surprisingly, we were only able to answer 1 our of every 4 questions. However, it was a good exercise that helped the entire team, including the product managers, see the problem. We followed this activity with a similar workshop for the entire team.

The team wasn't very enthusiastic or curious to know more about the product or understand the customer's business. Our hunch had been validated. The team wasn't looking at the forest and only focusing on a trees.


We knew we had a capable team, delivering working software every 2 days. So what was stopping the team from being proactive and curious about the customer's business?

We will keep you posted!
