You're in your final year of your engineering course. And you're starting to wonder what life is going to be like in the world outside after you graduate, in less than a year from now.

You've also made up your mind that the next step of your career is to get employed soon after graduation. Perhaps because you don't want to go through any more of the formal education process or because you want some real work experience before pursuing higher education.

Finally, you've been considering a career in software seriously. Perhaps because you're a computer science student or because that's where most of the jobs are, or because the pay seems to be better in the software industry or because you're totally into programming. Or because that is what your family or friends expect you to do.###The Problem

These are some of well known large Indian software companies visiting your campus. You find their interview process similar - and if you end up getting an offer from them, the result is similar too.

You are offered the position of a Software Trainee or a Software Engineer - but aren't sure what you are going to end up doing after the initial training program at the company. You could either be writing code, or testing software or waiting on the "bench" until the company has enough work for you to do.

You know that there are other options available and that you can be in more control of your career, if you want to be. But you need help in figuring things out.

###The Solution

Here's a simple process to help you make a more informed decision about the very first software company you choose to join:

*Find out what role suits you best

	
*Learn what types of software companies exist today

	
*Learn how to research a company

	
*Make a list of preferred companies and rank them according to your preference

	
*Apply to those companies in that order for the specific role of your choice
Take a look at this flowchart:

###Choosing your role

3 key roles to consider are 
Programmer, Business Analyst/Tester and that of a Designer. Here's how you can find out which of these would suit you best:

Programmer
The more items you can check off in the following list, the more you'll enjoy a programming role:

*You talk more about programming than most other topics with your friends

	
*You read articles on Hackernews during your free time

	
*You like coding competitions

	
*You've lost track of time and were too late for breakfast/lunch/dinner because you were...
.writing code

	
*You routinely stay awake overnight to finish a coding project

	
*You come up with problems to solve and then build apps to solve them

	
*You skip theory 
classes, but are always present in the lab coding a solution to a problem

Designer
If you've got talent for design, then you'll be happy to know that you're in a highly sought after minority today. If you find yourself saying "yes" for the questions below, then this could be your calling.

*Have you got appreciation from friends & mentors for your presentation slides?

	
*Have you spent nights admiring and wondering what it takes to create beautifully designed remarkable products?

	
*Do you have a flair for working with tools like Photoshop or GIMP?

	
*Do you love learning about the latest techniques in CSS3 and trying them out on an example project?

	
*Are you a huge fan of Apple? Do you usually end up supporting them in iOS 
vs Android discussions?

	
*In group projects, are you always asked to play the role of the Designer?

	
*Have you volunteered to design posters and flyers for events?

Business Analyst/Tester
We don't have enough good analysts and testers in software. If you're anything like the person below, then take the plunge and try this 
role out. You'll likely do very well.

*You become ecstatic when you find a bug on a website

	
*You spend time documenting about your findings

	
*You have a habit of writing things down - so you don’t forget it later

	
*You've volunteered to be the tester while working on academic projects

	
*You gave useful feedback when your friend asked you to look at his software product

	
*You read articles on Software Development Life Cycle during your free time

	
*You successfully juggle multiple items while getting things done on time

	
*You sketch out various test cases, data sets and permutations and combinations to find a bug

###Types of Software Companies:

Software companies earn their revenue by focusing primarily on one of the following things: Services, Product or Consulting.

***Services**
: If someone came over to you and asked you to build a web site for their existing business - to automate something that they're now doing manually, and you decide to entertain their request - then you've just won yourself a customer for your "services"
.Key points:

*Your customer owns the rights to the code

	
*You are servicing a small number of customers at a time

	
*Your fee is either based on the hours you spend building the app or on a pre-fixed price for the features you create

Should you join a 
Services company?
You should consider joining a 
Services company if you're more interested in the Business domain than specifically about the software side of the equation. So if you want to become an expert in a certain domain like Insurance, Banking, Manufacturing or Retail, then this could be your thing.

	
***Product**
: If you find a problem that needs to be solved for multiple people and know how to solve it by building a web or mobile app, then you may have a good product idea on your hands. Key Points:

*You own the rights to the code

	
*You can work with many more customers at a time

	
*Your pricing will depend on how well you can market the value of your product

Should you join a Product company?
Products are harder than services. Because not only do you need to build the software, you also need to know how to find a market for it and then sell it to that market. What does that mean for you, as a software professional?

Well, for starters, what that means is that it can get a lot more intense. You will need to be at the top of your game - whether its programming, analysis or design. And you'll need to move fast.

What that also means is that you'll need to really like the world of software in general. Otherwise, you'll burn out quickly.

In return for all that hard work, you'll end up learning how some of the most successful software businesses work. This is a good option if you have entrepreneurial ambitions of your own.

	
***Consulting**
: Let's say you develop a deep interest 
for artificial intelligence [AI]. That is an area which has few experts. But 
its a skill that very much in demand. When a customer approaches you for some AI help, you're not offering your services anymore, you're consulting. Key points:

*Your goal is not just to solve the customer's immediate problem, instead you're being hired to help them become self-sufficient in the long term. So your job is to teach/train your customer, so they can be on their own after a while.

	
*You get paid a lot more money per hour for doing this, than for doing more commonly available services.

	
*You get to focus on a few key skills - and will continue to gain more deep expertise in those specific 
areas ensuring that you remain the expert in that field.
Software Consultancies are a newer category than Services and Products. These kinds of companies exist at the intersection of Products and Services. Why?


![software_consultancy](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/software_consultancy-1.jpg)

Because they're usually in the business of building products for their customers. But while they build the product, they don't own the product. They only 
help to make the product successful by using their knowledge and skills - to guide their customer.

Should you join a Consultancy?
If you're the kind of person who likes variety in your work, then you'll like working at a consultancy. In these companies, you will end up working with many more customers (than in a services company) in a certain year usually from various industries and types of businesses.

Consultancies also tend to be smaller companies - by the nature of the fact that they're specialists in what they do. So you're likely to enjoy in working 
at a consultancy if you like being part of a 
smaller team as well.

These companies are great places to work to learn the in's and out's of a business. The culture tends to be one of high transparency - all the way up to the financial level. You should expect that your requests to share what-is-usually-considered confidential information, will be entertained by the senior management at the company.

###The Size Factor:

Should you join a big company, a medium sized one or a small one? Does it matter?

Here's our definition of what Big, Medium and Small means:

*Large Services Companies: These companies employ more than 50,000 people and the largest companies in India have more than 100,000.

*Work environment/Culture: Likely to be more hierarchical and have a top down management structure. The average team size 
on a project is in the 50-100 range.

	
*You'll like working here if:

*You look forward to working in a highly structured environment.

	
*You want to become an expert in a certain domain like Insurance, Banking, Manufacturing or Retail.

	
*You're keen on learning how large companies function

	
*Working abroad is one of your key goals. 
NOTE: Working abroad is not the same as traveling abroad. You can still do the latter without the former.

	
*You would want to work only those companies that your parents and relatives would recommend.

	
*Large Product Companies: These companies employ more than 10,000 people (across the world).

*Work environment/Culture: More autonomy in decision making. Individual contribution is valued more. Team sizes are in the 5-10 range and you're likely to have more impact on the product you're building.

	
*You'll like working here if:

*You want to learn how massively successful products are built and maintained

	
*You want to learn how large products are broken down into many small sub-products, then built as separate pieces in parallel - while keeping the larger picture in mind

	
*You like to take on highly challenging work (in programming, analysis or design) - while also being held accountable for delivering high value on a daily basis.

	
*You want to be paid a 
lot of money. Yes, these companies are best paymasters in the country today.

	
*Large Software Consultancies: Large Software consultancies are a rarity. This is probably because the consultants who work here tend to see themselves more like entrepreneurs [that is, who want to play a key role in shaping the company] rather than just as employees. As you can imagine, 
its not easy to build a large business where everyone has such a significant role to play.

	
*You'll like working here if:

	
**You want to learn

	
*You want to learn how large products are broken down into many small sub-products, then built as separate pieces in parallel - while keeping the larger picture in mind

###How to apply to your preferred companies:

This will depend on the type of company. Most companies have the application process detailed in the career section of their website. As part of the application process, you'll 
be usually asked to mention why you want to join their team.

A good technique to get the attention of the person who evaluates your application form - is to demonstrate your process of evaluating companies. Feel free to use the techniques mentioned to make your case. You'll likely end up being more successful.
