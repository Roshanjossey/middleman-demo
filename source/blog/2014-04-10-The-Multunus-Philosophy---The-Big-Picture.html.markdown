##The Big Picture

This is a deep dive into the Multunus Philosophy, why we exist, how we achieve our mission, and finally, what we do on a daily basis.


[![The Big Picture (2)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-2-300x225.jpg)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-2.jpg)

###Why?

We exist to help entrepreneurs (& intrapreneurs too!) succeed.

Entrepreneurs and their activities are a critical determinant of the level of success, prosperity, growth and opportunity in any economy.

We've worked with dozens of entrepreneurs in the past and tweaked the Multunus Philosophy over the years. This is our attempt to share with you what we've learnt: What methods work best when working with startups and why we think our techniques can help make entrepreneurs succeed?

###How?


At the core, it basically a mindset of[Deliberate Discovery](http://dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/). What that means is that we're consciously trying to increase our awareness of the many unknowns that lie out there.

Let's look at this definition of a 
[startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) from 
[Eric Ries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries):

>A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

Considering that the environment is extremely uncertain, the first thing that we do, is to accept that fact - and try to actively discover the bad stuff that's out there.


The good news is that if we find those things early enough, we've still got enough runway to release and iterate the product - and make it successful.

So how does Deliberate Discovery form a part of the Multunus Philosophy and work on a day to day basis?

###What?


[![The Big Picture (4)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-4-300x225.jpg)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-4.jpg)


It boils down to 3 basic things: 

*Building a Culture of Courage, Mindfulness and Constant Improvement

	
*Adhering to (or sometimes creating) processes that are best suited for the job at hand, and lastly

	
*Using the most relevant and contemporary technologies and tools

Culture
The following aspects of Culture helps us to achieve our mission:

*Interdependence

	
*Lean Thinking

	
*Systems Thinking, and

	
*Theory of Constraints

Interdependence

In our world, the customer is a part of our team. And hence we depend on her what what she's best in - whether its domain knowledge or other specific details about the product idea. 


It should now be obvious that the team inside Multunus works as a cohesive unit - to create a nice blend of talent and skills, thats required to build complex products.

Lean Thinking
This is a concept pioneered by Toyota. The central concepts here are Waste Identification and Elimination.


Waste happens when we consume more resources than necessary to achieve our goals. Seven types of waste have been identified including Transportation, Inventory and Defects. 


Lean Thinking heightens awareness and gives a whole new perspectives on identifying waste. Once the waste is identified previously hidden opportunities to eliminate them also get discovered. 


And all of this helps in continuous improvement of efficiency.

Systems Thinking
Missing the forest for the trees is a common problem. While building a product however, this can be a fatal problem.

Its critical to maintain a macro perspective of the whole product during the whole product development process. This helps in creating a user experience that is seamless and fluid.

Its also essential for ensuring that enough attention is being paid to the business model around the product, while the product is being built.

Theory of Constraints
This concept was born out of a book called 
[The Goal](http://www.amazon.in/The-Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951) by 
[Eliyahu Goldratt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt).


The idea is that almost any system is limited from reaching goals by a very small number of constraints. And there's also a process to identify the constraint and to restructure the rest of the team around it. 


For example, on a typical software team the programmers are the constraint. All of other activities such as requirement analysis, design and testing - are much less time consuming that writing working code. 


So, everyone else on the team ensures that the programmers are never kept waiting for anything. To learn more about how this is exactly done, make sure to read the Collaboration post to find out how we work around this constraint.

Let’s moving on to the next part of the “What”,  the Process.

Process

Our process has 3 main components: 

*Extreme Programming

	
*Kanban

	
*Continuous Delivery

Extreme Programming
Extreme Programming or 
[XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) for short is a set of values, principles and practices.


[![The Big Picture (10)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-10-300x225.jpg)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Big-Picture-10.jpg)

The box on the right shows the list of practices that form Extreme Programming. And the box on the left lists various concepts that are the foundation for the various practices. As you can, the list of practices is quite extensive.

Its an agile methodology that is unique in its focus on maintaining low technical debt. Technical Debt is a concept that is explained in more detail in the Sustainable Engineering post.


XP is quite central to the way we do things at Multunus. So, let's take a deeper look at it: 


We've been practicing XP at Multunus since 2010 - and we can tell you from direct experience, that all of those practices mesh so well together, that we never end up feeling the weight of the process. 


Instead, there's a sense of calm that prevails - a mind like water.

Kanban

[Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) comes to us from the Lean Thinking world - again an idea from Toyota. Kanban  tells us exactly how much time it takes a unit of work to go from an idea to running code in production. 


Beyond that, it also gives us tools [such as Work in Progress Limits] to bubble up constraints in the workflow. 


Finally, it encourages the team to maintain a continuous flow of updates through the system - thereby making Continuous Delivery much more feasible.

Continuous Delivery

[Continuous Delivery](http://www.continuousdelivery.in), as the term indicates, the idea is to continually update new features in production. At Multunus, we do this at least once every two days.

This requires a very high level of automation in the deployment workflow - in everything from testing to deployment.

We’ve now covered the first two parts of the “What”: Culture and Process. Let’s talk about the third aspect, tools and technologies.

Technologies and Tools

We 
[specialize](http://www.multunus.com/services/) in (but are not limited to), Ruby on Rails, HTML5, Javascript, Android and iOS. More importantly, we test drive all our code - which means we're well versed with a host of test frameworks and tools out there. 


As with any good team, we move with the times - as and when better technologies are introduced. What will remain constant however, is our commitment to automated tests and test driven development.

In the forthcoming posts, we'll explain how we convert all these high level ideas into working products.
