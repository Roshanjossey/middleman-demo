[![Functional Conf](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZeBEzBaOL_I/VDbOz_ApUvI/AAAAAAAAEEY/f9J3N6hj60I/w958-h476-no/_DSC3081.JPG)](https://plus.google.com/photos/116032120924821459278/albums/6068264927757876177?sort=1)

It was an amazing two days on October 9th and 10th, 2014 with the first of its kind 
[FunctionalConf in Asia](http://functionalconf.com/). I went to the conference with an (obvious!) expectation of learning more about Functional Programming but, I came back 
learning more about "
learnability" and the "Art of Learning", which was pleasantly surprising.

At any conference, the conversations that you have with others are equally important as the sessions. It was not any different at FunctionalConf either. I met new folks, old friends  after many years [you know, those folks who you meet 
 at conferences :)] and  others with whom I’d interacted only over email.

##It's Different

Functional Programming [FP] is 
**different,** but not actually 
**new**. 
[APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), a programming language developed in the 1960s 
[based on a mathematical notation for manipulating arrays] can be considered as the first FP language which was a great influence in creating many other FP languages and also for the development of Spreadsheets. But then, the question arises why didn't it become "mainstream"?

Let's park that question for a while. Let's look at what makes FP different. Other than the most important and widely known 
[Concurrency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing), some of the other differences are:

*Immutability

	
*Referential Transparency

	
*Declarative Style

	
*Expressions over Statements

	
*Opinionated
The code becomes more readable, maintainable and easier to test because of the above mentioned reasons.

##Crossing the Chasm

Let's come back to the question, why FP is still considered new? One of the reasons being 
[Change is Hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpiDWeRN4UA) for humans and it's no different for Programmers. And, the adoption curve  mentioned in the book 
[Crossing the Chasm](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123) applies to both Language adoption and Paradigm adoption.

##Learning Style

And the other main reason is how we learn. Our learning mechanisms are not efficient enough, because of which we don’t end up learning in the way we should have learned. This is pretty much the same case with our education system and that's why subjects such as Geometry or Mathematics are considered to be very hard for the students.

Similar thoughts apply to agile and TDD. Neither will 
[TDD ever die](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html), nor will there be a need to 
[kill ](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/)[agile](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) - instead it's time for us to 
reconsider TDD and agile. Value 
[Individuals and Interactions](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and agile will be fine.

##The Solution

So, how 
should we learn? By being kind and being generous.

Building a community is never hard.  It has been proven by Ruby on Rails community that because of the i
nternet and the social media, community building has become easy. So, we can learn together by sharing with others. It will take time, so be patient and kind to yourself and others too. And, take baby steps over a big bang approach. Even if you are not working with any FP language, some concepts can still be adopted. For 
e.g. - 
You can follow the below guidelines and get some power of FP.

*Avoid mutation

	
*Avoid 
void methods

	
*Avoid mutable 
globals - such as static variables

	
*Avoid returning null
"Avoid" means, keep those to the very minimum. As the language is not based on FP, it would be hard to implement all the above guidelines all the time. But by keeping it to the minimum, you can see that the 
codebase becomes more maintainable, readable and easier to test too!

It's true  that it's not same as using a FP language, but it will be better than doing nothing. Take these baby steps so that the adoption 
to 
FP paradigm becomes easy.

And, I am glad that at Multunus, these guidelines are much easier to adopt since we are using Ruby. We are following some of 
them, but we are yet to implement the major one - "Avoid Mutation".

##What's next

New things are hard to adopt and you need to be patient. But that  does not mean that we should start 
late. Start right away.

Five of us who attended the FuctionalConf discussed with other programmers about these "aha" moments we got from the conference. We have decided to use the Learning Forums, which we use for learning together by watching/reading things and discussing them. These 
forums help us to experiment and research about things for which we may not get 
time while we are working on the project. We decided to include FP in these forums to keep the current momentum going.


[FP group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/fnprog) has already been created as per the feedback received from the audience during the conference. So, join the group to keep close to the community and to learn.

Kudos to Naresh and team for 
organising such an awesome event. 
A lot of hard work goes into 
organizing something this awesome - so, hats off to them and looking forward for future editions.

The videos will be available 
on YouTube in 
a couple of weeks' time, which would help those who missed the conference. And for the attendees, it would be a good recap.

##More to come

The above is mainly the summary of 
the sessions mentioned below:

*[Joy of Functional Programming](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/420/keynote-the-joy-of-functional-programming) - Keynote by Venkat Subramaniam

	
*[Methodologies, Mathematics and the Metalinguistic Implications of Swift](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/712/methodologies-mathematics-and-the-metalinguistic-implications-of-swift)- Keynote by Daniel Steinberg

	
*[Fear -  Role of Fear in Language Adoption](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/711/fear-the-role-of-fear-in-language-adoption) - Keynote by Bruce Tate

	
*[Functional Programming in Java](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/321/functional-programming-in-java) - by Premanand Chandrasekaran
But, does that mean that the other sessions weren't good? Definitely not! But, it's not possible to write about all of them in just 
a couple of pages. Hence, we will be publishing some more posts which will 
contain 
a summary about other talks.
