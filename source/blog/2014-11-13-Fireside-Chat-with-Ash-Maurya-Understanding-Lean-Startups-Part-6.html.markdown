**Ram:**
 Just to continue with what LinkedIn founder said - whenever you release your product, you will be embarrassed. So, release fast…

My question is, what would be an MVP for a  VDP?


**Ash:**
 I have a simple definition for MVP- Minimum Viable Product, it's the smallest unit that you can build that will deliver value to your customer. That's the first exchange. Once they have value, then if you can collect some of their feedback, capture it back and run more tests.

In the VDP world, I'd say, if you start bringing in MVP say, you are building software and building all the features in it. Its a 3 months' process.  A part of the negotiation interview is just to show customer the story of what you will be going to do for them and start negotiating which features should be in here and which shouldn't.

So, you are trying to reduce down those features that they spoke of in the beginning. If the whole thing is going to take you 6 months or a year, you shrink it down to say 3 months and you give them something.

When I look at the MVP I usually like to draw a customer workflow diagram - this is what they are doing, this is what their existing process looks like, today, where does their problem start.

MVP has to start somewhere and stop somewhere. We want to find the smartest place where we can stop. Yeah! We can do everything but can we do this no. 1 thing?

So, the whole process against conversation is about building trust. You solve the most important problem for the customer, they are going to come back and ask you to do more for them. They want to work more. That's the thing to think about.

We need to strip down, now that all the feature are out on the plan, what is the smallest thing that we can build. And I also throw out the more creative ways of doing MVP on the <something> model.

What if you used this product and improved it because people want the ultimate benefit. They don't care how it was done. So, you might become a consultant. You can say you will charge about 100 euros for the results per month or whatever it is. This is called short circuiting.

So, its not so much about scaling but its about building something of value to the people.You demonstrate that you can you needn't worry about how to scale it.


**Leena:**
 Can you talk about


**Ash:**
 In the past, I had gone out looking for teams. It's a hard process. You have to find the right people to build the team culture. Then we stumbled into the team that became spark 59.

Initially, when I started writing this book I still had this other company. At some point I realized that I wanted to be doing what I am doing now, full time. I wanted to build this lean canvas online tool and I didn't have time to do it. I had a company and I was writing this book.

So, I put up a call for request on my blog and I said, “I want to build this MVP and I am looking for entrepreneurs who know what this thing is. So that we can spindle out faster.” I got 5 entrepreneurs respond to that and based on that we had a 2 week MVP development cycle and that was the best experience that I had with out sourced work.

In the past, when you had to bring people on the team, you had explain a lot of things, manage the outcome and a lot of project management than working on the project itself. But, in this case they were working on their own start ups hence, they knew what had to be done and also took the initiative and had the drive. So, that the way I recruited my first future employee.

Initially, we were working on side projects. That’s how I met Lucas based in Austria. I don't find boundaries with where people are placed, because in today's world you can work from anywhere. And to me, once I saw how good the relationship was, I made it a point to to only recruit other entrepreneurs.

To find good people with their own ideas working on their own things and trying to hire them - that's even harder. But that was the thing that I set myself to do. It became more of a relationship building process. So I tried people with the Spark 59.

There was usually some kind of project based work, we would just work together on the side, they had their own start up and I would advise them or help them and work together in whatever way they wanted me to work with them. And in exchange they were doing some work.

A lot of ways matched because they understood the minds of the customer and I think that's the most important thing. They had a passion for the customer and her problem and the work didn't feel much for them. They enjoyed doing it.

Some of the entrepreneurs have taken these ideas and built their own companies around it and I am happy for them. But, a number of them built things that won't work so they ended up saying let's just work as…


**Vaidy:**
 How many folks?


**Ash:**
 There are 5 of us and we are spread out. One is Lucas in Viana, we have Vernassa in Argentina, and there are 3 of us in different parts of the US.


**Vaidy:**
 So, no office?


**Ash:**
 Yeah, no office. We use and online tools, google hangouts at our offices to interact. I typically like to have times where I work by myself that is manager time of a concept. But there are some people, Lucas for example, timezone was an issue. He would be sleeping when we would start working and he would wake up when we would end.
