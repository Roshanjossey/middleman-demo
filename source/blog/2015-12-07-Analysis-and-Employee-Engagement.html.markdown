In my previous post -[Mountain Sickness and Employee Engagement](http://www.multunus.com/blog/2015/09/employee-engagement-moving-part-2/), I spoke about the 12 questions and how mountain sickness can be diagnosed in an organization.


In this one, I want to share with you how we have a session of employee engagement measurement at Multunus.


How likely is it that you would recommend Multunus to a friend?


In the previous post, we spoke about how each of the 12 eNPS survey questions point to particular sections of our employees' needs for being engaged. Employee Net Promoter Score is the score of how likely is an employee to go ahead and talk about your organisation without you [management] asking them to.





The 12 questions help us breakdown and understand the reasons for the employees being engaged/disengaged, but we need a grand question to figure out Employee Net Promoter Score, which is:





That makes it13questions.


You know what mountain sickness is, the importance of each of the camps and questions that are part of each of these camps on the hierarchy pyramid. [For a recap, 
[here’s the link to my previous post.](http://www.multunus.com/blog/2015/09/employee-engagement-moving-part-2/)]

Here’s a step by step guide to conduct the eNPS survey session:


*Create a[Google Form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)/[Typeform](http://www.typeform.com/)with the 13 questions. [We use Typeforms because of the experience it gives us and also, it is free]

    
*These questions are answered on a scale of 1 to 10.

    
*[Copy this Google Spreadsheet into your drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-ioAA_YvdToBXOLUQnRGmE_ft0TWOeYP8Su7xzoFo0/edit#gid=1589787795&vpid=A1)

    
*Integrate the Typeform entries to this Spreadsheet using[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)[which is very easy to use and is also free]

    
*Send the form out to all your folks and ask them to fill

    
*Analyse the survey results on the Google Spreadsheet

 


Here’s the snapshot of the typeform:

Here’s a sample of the spreadsheet [Note: the entries aren’t real]

Here’s how we do it:


Let’s take only the first question into consideration.


*All the employees that give a score of 9 and 10 are calledPromoters.These folks promote your company without you putting in any effort.

    
*All the employees that give a score that is >= 6 and <=8 are calledPassives.These folks are neutral. They aren’t particularly unhappy or happy.

    
*All the employees that give a score that is <6 are calledDetractors.These folks demote your company outside.


eNPS score =% of Promoters - % of Detractors


Analysis:


*eNPS < 0 -RED zone, which means the situation is pretty bad. Like, company’s going to fall apart badly. You need to do something super urgent.

    
*eNPS > 0 < = 50 -YELLOW zone. This means that you are not in great danger, but you really need to buckle up. You either can fall into the red or the green.

    
*“Where to improve” is explained in the next section which talks about analyzing the rest of the 12 questions

    
*eNPS > 50 -GREEN and you can celebrate it with a party.


Now, let’s take rest of the 12 questions into consideration:


Analysis:


*Calculate the percentage of promoters and detractors for each of the categories

    
*Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. This is the score for each category.

    
*If any of the lower categories in the hierarchy pyramid score lower than the higher categories, then we have a case of Mountain Sickness.

    
*Start taking measures prioritizing the lowest level on the hierarchy pyramid from where the mountain sickness is seen.


For example, if the scores of Basic Needs, Individual Needs, Team and Growth are 40, 35, 60 and 50 respectively, the mountain sickness starts at Basic Needs, since it is scoring lower than Team and Growth. The reason being, Mountain Sickness can be eradicated only if  the strengthening begins as a bottom-up approach.


##Our Story:



We took the eNPS survey at Multunus in March and our score was 11. That means, we were in Yellow. We discovered that we had Mountain Sickness and it started with Basic Needs.


By then, we had adopted something called the One on Ones where, each individual had a goto person whom we call “ The Manager”. The word manager means something other than what is usually perceived by people.


During these O3 sessions an employee can talk to the manager, she has been assigned to about anything. Wins, frustrations, life and the list goes on. We found that most of our folks were frustrated with the infrastructure needs. We also found that we could have a better compensation system as well to help them get engaged at the Basic needs level better.


Hence, we created a system to improve our infrastructure by getting better internet and faster machines. We are also on the endeavour of replacing all our machines with Macs. As far as our compensation was concerned, we created a system called the Open Salary System [OSS].


Vaguely explaining, OSS makes with the salary system autonomous, democratic and open.


We put out all the figures of profits and projections for Multunus and let our folks decide their own compensation. If you are wondering how we did that, then we have a post on OSS.


We rolled out another eNPS survey the following month, after the changes were made. This time the score was 27. Yes, we had improved, but we were still in Yellow and also we weren’t successful in eradicating mountain sickness. We were just able to improve scores on the Basic Needs level.


How can we make significant improvements? I will answer that in my next post.
