[Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) says “
[XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) is a path of improvement to excellence for people coming together to develop software.” Being a follower of XP, we have designed the Multunus Hiring Philosophy to continually improve to get the most suitable people to Multunus.

According to the Multunus Hiring Philosophy, we handpick people who are not only geeks but are also open to new ideas, willing to experiment and respectfully challenge the status quo - a good cultural fit into the Multunus way of life. Without a good cultural fit, we cannot provide value to our own people and our customers.

Finding good candidate is easy. Right! There is almost never a good candidate! Never ever! So we have a proactive hiring process. We are on an eternal scouting mission.

In the last 6 years, we have experimented with and continuously improved our hiring process. We don’t hire a person looking at their resume. For roles in programming and business analysis the candidate has to take up a challenge (
[Twitter puzzle](http://puzzle.multunus.com/), 
[Trello challenge](http://www.multunus.com/careers/business-analyst)). For senior hires, the candidate has to research on Multunus and engage the interviewer in a telephonic conversation for at least 30 minutes.

If the solutions to the puzzles are correct we engage with the candidate and lead her to researching more about Multunus and our culture. We have observed that there is a direct correlation between the research a candidate does and the likelihood of the person tenuring at Multunus.

Over the years, we have gradually increased the friction making it increasingly difficult to get into Multunus. The friction ensured that only the serious candidates with the right skills and attitude get through the funnel. It has increased the efficiency of our hiring effort.

On an average we have 15 person hours of interaction with every candidate who makes it to the final round. If we had too many rejections at the final round then the efficiency of our process would be rather low. Hence our process is designed to reduce the dropout at the last stage. Currently we have an efficiency of 10%.

Finding a candidate with right fit isn’t easy and we have only made it even harder! So how do we go about this? We realized that outbound hiring or brute force hiring wouldn’t work with the genre of our target group. Acting on our validated learning (yes! we are practitioners of the 
[Lean Startup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup)) we have almost stopped outbound hiring. We heavily depend on inbound hiring and word of mouth to attract talent.

We rely on the following channels to reach out to candidates:

*Employee referrals

	
*Community events like 
[Code Retreats](http://www.multunus.com/ajde_events/code-retreat-venkat-april-2014/) and 
[OpenHacks](http://www.multunus.com/ajde_events/open-hack-multunus-may-2014/)

	
*Networking events during 
[conferences](http://www.multunus.com/blog/2014/03/experience-rubyconf-india-2014/)

	
*Encrypted job ads on specialized job sites (like 
[Hasjob](https://hasjob.co/view/l2ed7))

	
*Campus interviews
Most people we have ended up hiring have come into the funnel through one of the above channels. We have almost never hired a successful candidate using a conventional job ad. I will walk you through the stories of each of the channels in subsequent posts.

At Multunus, we believe in 
[continuous delivery](http://www.multunus.com/continuous-delivery/) enabled through continuous improvement. So we work on hiring every day and on improving the process every day. By the time I would have completed blogging about the hiring philosophy, the process would have been further tweaked :).

Come back to read more about our experiences using the different hiring channels.
