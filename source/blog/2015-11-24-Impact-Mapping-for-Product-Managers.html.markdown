Are you finding it difficult to explain to your delivery team as to why a certain feature has to be built?

Are you finding it difficult to convince your customer why a certain feature may not be necessary?

Do you have trouble in justifying what has been built is the right thing?

I've successfully used the Impact Mapping technique to answer all of the above questions.##Impact Mapping - the Book


Impact mapping is a great way to collaborate with your customer and your delivery team. After doing an impact mapping session, all the participants of the project will be able to connect the dots to the goal of the project.

Impact mapping will help you in prioritising features/tasks and plan for fast delivery of the product iteratively.

Below are my notes from the 
[Impact mapping](http://www.amazon.in/Impact-Mapping-software-products-projects-ebook/dp/B009KWDKVA) book by 
[Gojko Adzic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojko_Adzic).


##Conducting an Impact Mapping Workshop


Impact mapping works best when worked in groups including senior technical and business people. Two reasons for doing this is to:


*Leverage the wisdom of crowds

    
*Obtain good results faster than a single person working on the impact mapping

Coming up with a good measurable goal is important for impact mapping. It is suggested to do it in two sessions:


*Define expected business goals and measurement (Preparation)

    
*Create impact map (Mapping)


###Preparation



*Discover real goals

    
*Define good measurement

    
*Plan your first milestone


###Mapping



*Draw the map skeleton

    
*Find alternatives

    
*Find key priorities

    
*Earn or learn


Preparation Step 1: Discover real goals

Most of the projects start with customers asking for features and solutions. The business objectives exist only inside the customer's head, but they are not expressed or known to anyone else. This leads the project to failure for two reasons:


*Customers are usually not technology experts so the solutions they propose are not optimal. When the business goals are not clearly communicated, the technology consultants might not be able to suggest or provide optimal technology solution if it exists.

    
*Even when the initial solutions are right thing to do, the technology landscape changes so rapidly that the underlying assumptions might stop being valid during the course of implementation. When business objectives are not clearly stated it becomes impossible to spot that the situation has changed and a new solution is required.

The first step in defining a good road map is defining the expected business goals and having everyone agreeing to it. Try to come up with one mission statement that everyone agrees on. Identify possible goals and make sure to list down on the whiteboard. Make sure you have an agreement on number of objective deliverables from the project. It is good if the group limits itself to delivering one objective per milestone if possible

If you cannot find any objectives start with the suggested feature. Start asking why is this important? Whose behaviour will this change? Why is changing behaviour important?


This is similar to the 
[5 Why's technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).


>"You should get to something that clearly shows how to save money, earn money or protect money." - 
**Chris Matt**



Preparation Step 2: Define good measurement

Clearly defined goals are important to come with impact map. Discussing the measurement of those business objectives will open up conversations on viability and prioritisation. Below is a simple version to measure the business goals:


*What we'll measure? (Scale)

    
*How we'll measure? (Meter)

    
*What is the situation like right now? (Benchmark)

    
*The minimum acceptable value, break even point for investment (Constraint)

    
*The desired value (Target)

Don't worry if you do not have all the numbers, assign action items to people to have these numbers by next meeting. That is why it is good to plan for two meetings. Beware of measuring what is easy to track instead what is valuable.


Preparation Step 3: Plan your first milestone

Once you have come up with business goals and good measurement, check if these goals are really part of the current milestone or if this can postponed to the future milestones that has to be achieved.

The author usually uses the dot-voting technique where everyone in the room gets certain dots that they can place it next to the business goals. Sometimes using virtual cash can make things more precise. Create cash out of post-its (Ex: Write $100 on post-it) and distribute to everyone in the room, so that everyone in the room gets fewer post-its than the number of goals. Another option is to distribute Monopoly money or play money and ask the business people to place their money on the business goals. The number of dots or virtual cash budget gives you a list or priorities.

Teams that are capable of delivering iteratively should think about working on one business goal at a time. Five consecutive goals where each fulfils one business objective is generally much better than one milestone that fulfils five partially, because the landscape might change once a key objective is achieved.

Example :


**Milestone 1:**

More players, 100% increase in IT cost allowed if necessary.

**Milestone 2:**
No damage to number of players or retention, reduce IT costs

Ask:


>"If we achieve the key targets for metrics with a completely different scope than planned, have we succeeded?"



If the answer is 'No': go back to the start: You don't have right metrics.


Mapping Step 1: Draw the map skeleton
The first step in drawing the map is to create a skeleton. Put the first milestone in the middle of the map and connect some high level deliverables to it. People in the room will already have some idea on on the deliverables that has to be part of the first milestone. Identify the underlying assumption that are crucial to get everyone on the same page. The initial set of actors, impacts and deliverables will help facilitate ideation and inspire people to look for alternatives.

If you are working with a group that has already come up with requirements dictated in the form of a shopping list, pick few crucial items from the list and chalk them out. The shopping list that customers have come up with are a result of months of planning and approvals. They may have some good ideas that can be used. There is no point in reinventing the wheel. On the other hand, many of the ideas may be based on wrong assumptions, and impact mapping will help to uncover such cases quickly. The people who have come up with the initial list may have a lot of emotional attachment to their ideas, and by putting them into the map skeleton we show that we're valuing their opinions.

Make sure to define precisely the actors and impacts, double check if the connection still makes sense. Below are few questions that you can ask at this point:

*Is it realistic that the feature will contribute to the impact?

    
*Is the impact valid for the actor?

    
*Will the impact really contribute to achieve the goal?
Yes, it sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised to know by the number of times people say 'no' to at least one of these questions after the initial attempt.

It is a good idea to split the large group into smaller groups and merge after 20 minutes, comparing the skeleton. This will help you to get a good skeleton sooner.

Mapping Step 2: Find alternatives

Now that you've established the key objectives and there is some structure in the map to discuss, try to define as many alternatives as you can in a time-boxed period, limiting the discussion to actors and their behaviour impacts. This corresponds to the diverge phase of design thinking. Diverge and merge. Get groups to work independently and review results after 20 minutes. The goal of this step is to find out better and cheaper ways to achieve the business objectives. Don't criticise any ideas, put all your ideas in there. Use the existing skeleton map to get inspiration and ask the following questions:


*What else those guys do for us?

    
*Who else can help us? How?

    
*Who can obstruct us?


[![Impact Mapping - Alternatives](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Im-1.jpg)](http://www.multunus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Im-1.jpg)

 


Mapping Step 3: Identify key priorities

Now comes the convergent thinking phase, now that we have plenty of options, we need to make some choices. Try to keep this phase informal, as most of the answers often arises from discussions. Start by asking the following questions:


*Look at the possible obstructions: What are the critical things that can stop us even before we start?

    
*Is there a high-value low-hanging-fruit impact somewhere?

    
*What are the key assumptions to test?

If this does not lead to a natural answer to the question where to start, you can use dot-voting or virtual money technique to get the group select the first few items to try. Try using two colours for dot-voting: 
red for critical and 
green for low-hanging-fruit impact.

The above 3 questions revolves around business activities and impacts, not deliverables or software scope. Ask customers to prioritize business impacts, not deliverables. Customers/Business users think more clearly about the business activities and impacts than software features, so they can prioritize better as well. Another option more useful for product design than project management, is to select an actor that should be satisfied first.

Mapping Step 4: Earn or learn

Having identifies the actors and impacts, we can start growing the third level of the map: Deliverables. In an ideal world, everything we do should contribute to the goal in the centre of the map. This ideal situation assumes that we'll always make the right decision, which is an illusion.

Ask the following questions to start a useful discussion on deliverables:


*What is the simplest way to support this activity? What else could we do?

    
*If we're unsure about assumptions? what is the simplest way to test it?

    
*Could we test it without software?

    
*Could we start earning with a partly manual process?

Impact map puts all the deliverables in context of the impacts that has to be created. This will help to break the deliverables into smaller independent chunks which will deliver value and helps in launching something valuable sooner. This will also help us removing some of the deliverables which may not contribute to the business goal. A clear hierarchy shows us how we can group the deliverables better, which actor should we invest more on and de-prioritize the other actors and their impacts.

Finally, by connecting the deliverables to impacts and goals, a map shows a chain of reasons that leads to feature suggestion.
