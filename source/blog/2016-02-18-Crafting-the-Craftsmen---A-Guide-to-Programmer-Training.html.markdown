We have observed some of our friends struggling to find a good resource list or structure as a starting point for their self-learning path or as a standard organizational training guide. We would like to assist them with it by sharing our knowledge on this topic. We thought we would make our training guide open to all so that others may also take ideas from it in the least, if not benefit from it.

At Multunus, we take our folks’ trainingseriously. Be it a fresh grad or an experienced individual, everybody who joins us as a Programmer goes through our rigorous training program. The aim is not to make people mug up things, it is to enable people to think and open their minds to new avenues of learning. This, along with some of our other policies like[investment time](http://www.multunus.com/blog/2016/01/20-investment-time-background-story/), accelerates their growth and learning curve.


[TL;DR - Jump to our resource list](#resources)


We don’t have a secret recipe for this. We depend heavily on the experts, leaders and the community to provide our learners with quality study material. We buy books, subscribe to online courses and provide a framework to help them take the learning path that we have found to be beneficial. However, we do not restrict or force them to follow the path. They are free to innovate and deviate as long as the end goal is met. We actually like to see their creativity in this regard, which is another aspect of what we expect people to gain from this program.


The program is heavily driven by quick feedback and suggestion cycles, and this is what we think makes it unique.Let’s look at it more closely.


#A Brief Walkthrough



Let us assume we have Jai as our new joiner. This story is about what is going to happen next in Jai’s life.


When Jai joins the training program, he is assigned a training buddy. The buddy helps him grow and learn throughout the program by clearing his doubts, giving and asking for feedback and the best part, by talking to him. These conversations encourage Jai to discuss his thoughts, ideas & learnings and develop the ability to view things from a different perspective.


###Task 1



The first task in our training program is to read a comic book. But not just any, it’s a book called[The Adventures of Johnny Bunko by Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com/books/johnny-bunko/). This book aids Jai in keeping an open mind on the journey he is about to embark upon. He is asked to share his take on this with all team members. This serves as a sort of ice-breaker.


###Task 2



Jai is asked to look at the[training sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxs7qP0W_cjbszTsYe-u8jWaUlAB8HTFV9LnteUkWU4/edit?usp=sharing)along with his buddy and come up with an estimate by when he thinks would be able to finish the training. It is okay if he doesn’t get it correct (since there is), it is just an. The training sheet itself consists of a list of resources (such as books, videos, etc.) on different technologies and an exercise to evaluate the relevant level of learning. The exercises are carefully crafted so that they make Jai reflect on his understanding of the core basics of the language.


###Learn, Code, Reflect, Repeat



Once Jai goes through the first part of the training, he now has a fair idea of how things are, what worked and what didn’t. He should reflect upon those and probably talk to his training buddy about making changes to the process and estimates. Again, he chooses what works for him. :)


The exercise submissions are evaluated by training buddy and discussions on areas of improvements as well as appreciations follow. Appreciations are an important part of the process. They encourage Jai, as our motto says,to keep the awesome coming.


###Background Threads



We have weekly reviews of how things are going with Jai. This makes us aware of how things look from his perspective, how is he doing on the estimates and how does his progress look like. Also, in these meetings Jai is asked about his opinion on things that he thinks need improvement or didn’t go well so that we may improve them for the next person. Jai is already helping build our company and culture!


By the end of the training program, we expect Jai to be an enlightened individual with a desire to learn, grow and opinionate. He now knows us better as a company and understands the way we operate. We, in turn, know Jai and his working habits better.


#Why We Think it Works



This structure has been working for us and been showing good results. Our folks who just came out of training have at times outperformed the seniors at the company. They have received a 10 on customer[NPS](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/)survey and worked with multi-million dollar startups as consultants to strengthen their engineering framework. So why do we think it works?


The key here is not to teach but kindle the desire to learn.


We believe that our training program acts as a catalyst and opens the doors to a wide world of knowledge and learning. Once you embrace that and start picking things on your own, there is no looking back.


The program itself is structured in a way that guides towards a better understanding and knowledge of the uses of every technology. Starting with object-oriented ruby revises the concepts of object oriented fundamentals. Building upon it, RSpec explains how and why Test Driven Development is the way to go for a maintainable and robust code. Learning HTML and CSS provides a completely different view of programming, separating from the world of objects. Things accelerate from here with JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks. Finally, Ruby on Rails converges everything learnt till now under one umbrella to reveal the power of combining different technologies and give the full-stack feel. Along the way, engineering practices such as Agile and Continuous Delivery are perpetually learnt and imbibed in daily working.


The exercises serve as a good way of quantifying the learnings. This helps us understand and work closely with our learner, and at the same time gives him an idea of how things are going to be in real life (read). In the hindsight, better estimations and timely deliveries are skills that are subconsciously built in their minds. There’s no pressure to deliver, but a well-informed structure which creates a habit of keeping everyone in the loop. This creates awareness about the impact of these skills on any project.


The review meetings facilitate getting quick feedback on their progress and where things are headed. This is the time for them to bring up concerns, ask questions (which, of course, they are free to do any other time too) and the most important of all, decide on what next. These are times when they can fully leverage the guidance and experience we are ready to provide them in exchange for their dedication.


Also, we don’t expect our folks toeverything. We want them to beout whatever and whenever they need it. The completion of training, we feel, is the beginning of a journey, not the destination. A journey which is worth celebrating. This obviously means that they have to treat us when they are done with the training.


Below is a list of resources we use for the program. Feel free to suggest additions or changes. Also, let us know about your training programs and why you think they work.
