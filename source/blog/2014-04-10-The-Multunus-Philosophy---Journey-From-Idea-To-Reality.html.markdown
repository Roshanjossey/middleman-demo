In the Big Picture post, we introduced our Culture, Processes and Technologies and explained about the process of deliberate discovery. In this part of The Multunus Philosophy, the Journey From Idea To Reality, we’ll explain the process we use to create the first version of the product from just an idea in about 8 weeks.

We start the process with the idea. At this stage, the idea may just be a single line idea or there may have been more details to share, if the customer has had a chance to invest time into the idea.

All the available information, serves as input for the first phase called the Exploratory Phase. The Exploratory Phase is the Construction Phase.

So, what are the questions that we try to get answered during this phase?

We start with questions that help us understand the product at a greater level of detail - such as “What problems does it solve?” and “Who are the target users?”

We then move on to solution related questions such as “What features make most sense for the first couple of releases?”, “How long it will take to build these features?” - and based on that additional information and estimates, “What would be the priority of each feature?”.

Finally, we move onto project schedule and cost related questions.


In the process of answering these questions, we create a set of deliverables. The entire Exploratory Phase is documented and the documentation shared with the customer at the end of the phase.

The product idea is broken down into a list of high level features and further broken down into called 
[Stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Its the stories that eventually get converted into working software. Once all stories that form a feature are coded and shipped, we call that the feature complete.

While the features and the stories are verbal descriptions of the idea, it is the Low Fidelity Wireframes that help visualize the product through the eyes of the end user. We call them low fidelity because the stress at this stage of the project is to focus on the functional requirements and interaction of the user with the product, rather than aesthetic elements such as colors and fonts.

The architect starts getting involved in the project during the Exploratory Phase. This helps to set an appropriate technological direction for the project and in turn ensures that we provide a more confident estimate of time and cost for the whole project.

At this point we share our estimates of time and cost with the customer. We also present our recommendations on scope based on the priorities of the customer.

It takes about 2 weeks to complete all the activities in the Exploratory Phase.

##Construction Phase 

The Construction Phase begins as soon as we have a green flag from the customer at the end of the Exploratory phase. As the name implies, we actually roll up our sleeves and start building the product during this phase.

>Like the Agile Manifesto says, “working software is the primary measure of progress”. Right from the work go, the team starts to hustle - with the goal of rapidly releasing the first few stories.

Since we’re building a software product, technology risks are best “Discovered” - or rather “Deliberately Discovered” as early on as possible.

Like the Agile Manifesto says, “working software is the primary measure of progress”. Right from the work go, the team starts to hustle - with the goal of rapidly releasing the first few stories.


We deliver working stories the very first week.

To keep the momentum, the team keeps releasing working software every 2-3 days after that - coupled with demos with the customer for each of these released stories.

As the project progresses, we inevitably find that some of the earlier documented stories need more details. What’s more, we also discover that new stories may need to be added. This is the norm in any software project. The way we react to accommodate these changes, is where the rubber hits the road.

While the programmers continue to code on the stories which have enough clarity, the rest of the team works with the customer, to make any scope changes. We like to keep the date of the first release sacrosanct - and keep everything else variable. This is the 
[Lean Startup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) philosophy - where the focus is always on releasing early - and getting feedback from the market.

The main deliverable from the Construction phase is of course working software. But how do we get there? There’s a bunch of things that come together to make the final product. Here’s a sample of that list.

An example of a fine grained business rule, think about a Sign Up form that needs to be filled in by the user and submitted. Depending on the number of fields on the form, we may to add a bunch of validations along with useful error messages for each of the fields. All of these tiny details are documented online - and linked to the appropriate story.


The goal of the team is to have a reasonably complete first version of the product in about 6-8 weeks. At that stage, it is the prerogative of the customer, as the owner of the product to decide whether to go live and open it up to real users - and wait to add more features before doing so.

So what’s the fine print? There isn't much really. But for the sake of transparency, here’s what we think may not very obvious.

There’s a LOT of communication - both written and over calls - that happens during both phases. So, the most important thing is the availability of the customer. Since the customer is the product owner, she is the only one who can tell us with complete certainty if we’re moving in the right direction.

As regards technology, we think we’re pretty good at what we do. Of course, that doesn’t mean we aren’t open to new ideas - but in general we like to make our own technology choices.

In the subsequent posts, we will do a  deeper dive into our team and the collaboration that happens during the Exploratory and Construction Phases.
